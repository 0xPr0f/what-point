# What point

docs to come, look for api requests in pages/api

## API calls
This project batches both testnet and mainnet api calls on the same url, differentiating them with the chainId      

Example     
Blast Testnet - https://what-point.vercel.app/api/168587773    
Blast Mainnet - https://what-point.vercel.app/api/81457       

Of course, you must not do this, the blast api doesnt do this, this was simple done to not have to host another api wrapper seperate from the one connected to this frontend
